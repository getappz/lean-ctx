//! Content-addressed recovery (CCR) for the proxy's lossy rewrites (#482).
//!
//! When the proxy prunes an old `tool_result` from conversation history, the
//! lossy stub used to say *"re-read the file"* — which is stale-unsafe by
//! construction: in an agent session files are edited or deleted between turns,
//! so a re-read returns the *current* bytes (or fails), not the historical
//! version the conversation actually showed. The model could then silently
//! reason about the wrong content.
//!
//! CCR fixes this by persisting the **verbatim original** to the shared,
//! content-addressed tee store (`{state}/tee/`, reused from the shell path) and
//! embedding a **retrieval handle** — the absolute path of that file — in the
//! stub. Retrieval is MCP-independent: the agent reads the path with its native
//! file read; no lean-ctx tool has to be attached.
//!
//! ## Cache-safety (#448)
//! The handle is the file path, and the path is a pure function of the content
//! hash ([`crate::core::hasher::hash_short`]). For a fixed pruned message the
//! handle is therefore byte-identical on every later turn, so the provider
//! prompt-cache prefix is never invalidated. The on-disk *write* is best-effort
//! and never affects the returned handle — only retrievability degrades if the
//! write (or the 24h TTL cleanup) loses the file, so a stub can never become
//! non-deterministic based on filesystem state.
